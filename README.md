## About Me

Hi, I'm Phil (he/him). I like to learn new things, especially by doing stuff. Here I expand my skillset in coding through personal projects and collaborations across Github.

I'm currently working on:
- **TikTok Data Extractor** - A tool written in Python to extract TikTok video links and other data from your personal TikTok json data file export. Check out my the [tt-extractor](https://github.com/philkasper/tt-extractor) repository for more info.


<!-- Add more stuff (like socials and how to reach me) -->
